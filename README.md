### Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify">

We will analyze the database “Set of Registered Deaths 2020” retrieved from the open data of the [Secretaría de Salud](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/defunciones) an official page of the Mexican government where public data is compiled regarding various health issues. This database has about 1.1 million records of deaths nationwide occurred in 2020, this database will be reviewed with the intention of showing some interesting situations occurred during that year, such as states with more suicides, which states had more deaths by covid or homicides by state. This in order to finally make a predictive model that will try to give you the most probable cause of death according to certain variables, its accuracy will be verified and conclusions will be drawn.

### Background

<div style="text-align: justify">

The year 2020 was a historic year worldwide, vaccines were being worked on by COVID-19 and the population was in a pandemic, in addition to the fact that not much was known about the virus and there was still no effective vaccine, the population worldwide was locked up for months without knowing what was going to happen, It is therefore important to see what happened during that year, specifically in the deaths that occurred, as well as to see the main causes of death that year, interesting age groups, presumed violent deaths, as well as other aspects that can be recovered from this database.
